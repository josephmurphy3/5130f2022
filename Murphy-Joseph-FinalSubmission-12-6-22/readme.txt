Hi, Welcome to my Final Project! I used Python, HTML and CSS in order to achieve my end goal.  I choose this as my final project because I want to do this topic because it is near and dear to me. I really enjoy traveling and I have to a lot for work as well. I have bought cheaper flights that had a layover in order to save money compared to a direct flight only to have the first leg of my flight delayed so then I missed the second leg and had to find the next flight from my layover to my end destination. I was stuck in my layover location and missed valuable time at my destination. Which ended up costing me more in the end. Also if this happened for a work trip it would cost my company valuable time and reputation and could cause them to lose sales and profit. So I believe something like this is very important so you can know the risk of an indirect flight vs a direct flight and make the decision based upon that. I made it so that if a layover is delayed over the next leg of the layover that it automatically chooses direct. As someone whos missed a layover connection it is a big pain to have to find the next flight out and everything so I wanted that heavily penalized. I choose to use python because I am the most confident with it and I believe it is the most powerful and can easily implement the api calls I needed.

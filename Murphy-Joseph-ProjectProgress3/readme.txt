This week I did not do as much as I wanted to because I had to travel for work but I was able to do vital imporvements that will benefit me in the long run. I originally was planning to use flightaware API but it cost money and didnt even show me the data i needed. After more research I was able to find https://rapidapi.com/amadeus-for-developers-amadeus-for-developers-default/api/flight-delay-prediction/details which gives me the percentage a certain flight will be delayed which is exactly what I need. Using that and the user input for cost I can calculate how much the flight will actually cost them based on time and then suggest what flight will be better. I also added the correct inputs to my website so now I recieve all the correct info I need from the user and start to make the api call.

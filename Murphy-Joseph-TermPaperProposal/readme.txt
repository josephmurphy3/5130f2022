With the rise of Open Source Software breaches, I will look into how often open source software breaches actually happen and what the damage of them have been. I will then try to prove that it might be better off not to use open source software. Companies use open source software believing they are inhererrently secure which opens them up to a world of breaches. We are seeing more and more bad actors use open source software to get their foot in the door at major organizations and programs. My term paper will dive into this and explore the new cybersecurity risk and how companies should manage it.

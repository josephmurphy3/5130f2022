Hi, I did not make as much progress as I hope as I did not see the approval status until later than I hoped due to it being in my spam. However, I was able to find a free api data that I will need in order to create my flight tracker and calculator website. It will allow me to run 500 free api calls per month or I can look to get a monthly subscription to view more if my website news it. https://aviationstack.com/  I also found a backup api that will allow me to also due the same thing if that first api call doesnt work. https://flightaware.com/commercial/aeroapi/ I will now start actually building up my website in the same way as my plans stated.

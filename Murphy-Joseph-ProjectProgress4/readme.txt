I have decided to completely revamp the backend and use python and Django to achieve what I need to with my website. I need something powerful enough to handle the api calls and hold variables while I do calculations while also being simple enough to have an easy to use UI. I have switched to include  https://rapidapi.com/aedbx-aedbx/api/aerodatabox/ api as it will provide me with the same information and all ill need to use for it is the flight number. It will give me the length of the average delay which I will use to calculate cost and see which is better for the user to choose. I can use this with the other API I found to get the most accurate information.

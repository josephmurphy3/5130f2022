The progress I made this week is the baseline of design of my site. I got it to look like the layout in my first ever project proposal and now my site looks like it. Now I can start integrating the API and figure out how to do the calculations. The site looks how I want it to for the most part, it is just missing a few cosmetic upgrades that will happen once the project is finished at the very end.

Hi,
This is my second submission, the main goal of this submission was to clean up the HTML and make my website nice to look at. I added a header/nav bar and make the overall
output a lot nicer to look at. I also changed the form so it would be easier for a user to enter in info. Everything I added is my code but for the header/navbar I did
use https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar_horizontal.asp as a base and went from there. I also took the Direct vs Layover logo from https://travellingwellman.com/travel-guides/layover-vs-direct/ and the Home logo from https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/home_25694
Thanks,
Joseph Murphy

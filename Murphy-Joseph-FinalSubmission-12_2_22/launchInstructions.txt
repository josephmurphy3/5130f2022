(Make sure to use weblab url, I had to work with the help desk to configure apache to run python scripts and they only configured weblab to work.)

Once you arrive at my site you have to sleect how many stops your layover has. So if the layover has one indirect stop you would select 1, 2 stops you would select two, and 3 you would select 3.
Then the next page asks you to enter in information for Direct flight (Direct Flight Number, Direct Time - When the flight leaves, Direct Cost - how much the flight costs)
and indirect flight infor (Layover Flight Number 1 - Flight number for the first flight, Layover Time 1 - When the first flight leaves, Layover Flight Number 2 - Flight number for the second flight, Layover 2 Time - When the second flight leaves,i.e. and Layover Cost - how much the  layover flights cost totally)
Then it will inform you whether the best option is direct or layover and if you would like to return home to try out another combo.

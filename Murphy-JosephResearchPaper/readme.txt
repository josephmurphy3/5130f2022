Paper Title : Security Strength of Open-source software

Abstract : With the rise of more software breaches, how secure are open-source programs in actuality? Does the risk outweigh the reward? “Global attacks increased by 28% in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. The average weekly attacks per organization worldwide reached over 1,130” (1). Open-source software is not anymore insecure than its counterpart, proprietary software. Actually, open-source software can be more secure and well maintained due to a variety of reasons. Open-source software has many different people that are viewing the code that allows bugs to be exposed faster than if it was closed source code; also, Open-source software has a great community that helps each other out. Most of the major recent breaches were actually associated with proprietary software, so it is important to know why this is and what this means for you and your organization. There are times where proprietary software is the better tool to use. It is also important to know how many of these breaches come into play and how to protect one’s code and organization from them. Open-source software is not any less secure than proprietary software and has great benefits over proprietary software as well.
